# Publish workflow using Trusted Publishing (OIDC) for PyPI and TestPyPI
#
# This workflow implements secure, token-less publishing following PyPA best practices:
# - https://packaging.python.org/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/
# - https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/
#
# Architecture:
# 1. build job: Creates wheel and sdist, uploads as artifact
# 2. publish-to-testpypi: Downloads artifact, publishes to TestPyPI (with skip-existing)
# 3. publish-to-pypi: Downloads artifact, publishes to PyPI (fail loudly on duplicates)
#
# Security features:
# - OIDC tokens (valid ~15 min) instead of long-lived tokens
# - Minimal permissions (id-token: write only in publish jobs)
# - GitHub environments for deployment protection
# - Action pinning for supply chain security
